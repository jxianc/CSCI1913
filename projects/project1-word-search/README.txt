You should assume the following:
 * the letter grid parameter has width W and height H.
 * The word parameter has length L.
 * concatenating a letter to a string takes O(1) time
 * the get_size function takes O(1) time
 * accessing a list by index takes O(1) time

Your task:

#Q1
What is the Big-O runtime of the extract function in terms of W, H, and L (defined above)

(Please attempt to explain your reasoning. An incorrect answer with no stated reasoning will not be suject to partial credit)

#Q2 
What is the Big-O runtime of the find function in terms of W, H, and L (defined above)

(Please attempt to explain your reasoning. An incorrect answer with no stated reasoning will not be suject to partial credit)
